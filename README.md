# What is pydat?

The Python Drought Analysis Tool (pydat) is a python package that automatically derives multi-year streamflow deficit Severity-Duration-Frequency (SDF) curves from streamflow data and empowers users to effortlessly create SDF curves. Also, it synthesizes daily-scale streamflow time series called streamflow analogs representing those SDFs. Alongside its core function, pydat offers several other useful commands, including:

1.	Presenting a comprehensive list of the stations in each state or watershed. 
2.	Displaying the streamflow time series of each USGS station.
 The package has been designed to address the need for streamflow deficit SDFs information and their usage in operational water management amid persistent streamflow drought conditions nationally in the United States (US).
Rainfall and flood frequency analysis methods are well established and widely used in analysis and design studies, including but not limited to stormwater management and design studies and hydraulic structures designs, etc. In contrast, no standard method(s) exist for persistent streamflow drought analysis and guidelines for water planners and managers to use in water supply planning and management studies. Although indices related to streamflow deficits are available in the literature, their limitation in usage in planning and operational way hinders their adaptation and useability among water planning and management agencies and utilities. Pydat has been developed to bridge this research and operations gap
